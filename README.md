# RPG-Game

This game is a role-playing game that consists of the evolution of a Polytechnique student within ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles). The main character is a student who, through various peripeties (like taking exams, partying, etc.), will have to progress in order to obtain his degree from Polytechnique.

The architecture is composed of 4 Design Patterns:
- Controller: contains the Keyboard class which allows to create commands for the game.
- main: contains the MainStudent class, which enables us to launch the program.
- Model: contains all the classes and interfaces needed to run the game. We
include:
  - Classes:
    - MoveAuto (which animates the character when it moves)
    - Enemy
    - Game
    - GameObject
    - Loot
    - Player
    - Shoot
    - Shop
  - Interfaces:
    - Directable
    - Life
    - Positionable
    - Updatable
- View: is composed of classes that enable display:
  - Map: allows the display of maps
  - Window: allows the creating of a window
This architecture allows us to clearly differenciate the controls, the game, and the display.
